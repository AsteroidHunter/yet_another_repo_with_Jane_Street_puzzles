    "- **Spoiler**: the final solution is wrong here, but the base intuition is right!\n",
    "### Intuition\n",
    "- To begin, I didn't think much about the shapes, but I imagined square as a set of points $x,\\,y \\in [a,\\,b]$ where $a$ and $b$ are some real numbers.\n",
    "    - I think this is a helpful framing for converting the problem into code + for generalizing the solution to n-dimensions (albeit not necessary here).\n",
    "- The corners of the diameters are simply two points sampled from these two set of points.\n",
    "- Finding the center of the circle is straightforward: it is simply the average of the two sampled points. \n",
    "- *(Here's where things went wrong)* For whatever reason, I thought that if the point on \n",
    "the circle which formed an isosceles triangle was inside the square, then the entire circle would be inside the square, so I chased this strain of thought, found the slope of the diameter \"inverted\" it, found where the line with that slope intersected with the circle, and then checked if those points were inside or outside the circle. \n",
    "- Another extra thing I did was varying the amounts of times I was sampling the points.\n",
    "    - The idea here is simple as well: if the answer converges as the number of points \n",
    "    sampled increases, then the math is sound.\n",
