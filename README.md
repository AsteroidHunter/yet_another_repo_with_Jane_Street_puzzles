# Yet Another Repo With Jane Street Puzzles
- My attempts at solving Jane Street puzzles using python and maybe Rust.
- What's different about this repo? Overall not much, but
  - I will try to explain my intuition behind the solutions
  - I *might* code in Rust; I noticed that there are only four other repositories with 
    Jane Street solutions in Rust, and only one of them seems active. So, quite 
    *neglected* as the cool kids say!
  - In some cases, I will also explain the basic math, because I may not know the 
    concept necessary to solve the problem.
